# pTFE-Cloud-Deploy

# Goals 
Firstly, it was for my own learning of Terraform but after adding more and more functions, I wanted to share it.
Could be a base for someone who would like to create a multi cloud deployment of their infrastructure.

- The first step is to be able to deploy pTFE (Private Terraform Enterprise) to Azure, Aws and GCP in one place. 
- Second one, will be adding the possibility to deploy the whole Hashistack on any cloud.

# How to use it
